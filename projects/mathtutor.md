 In high school, I volunteered to be a math tutor, as I held a position in the National Honor Society.
As a junior and senior, I mostly tutored middle schoolers and freshmen. I helped break down
formulas and concepts in Algebra and Geometry in much the same terms. The whole experience 
highlighted the importance of having patience to explain each problem clearly. By taking the time
to think of my own examples and walking them through step by step, I was able to help students succeed while
improving my own mentorship skills. From this experience, I hope to apply this knowledge in my future
academic and professional endeavors.
