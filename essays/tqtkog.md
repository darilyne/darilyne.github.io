  What defines a SMART question? The process of asking a SMART question is not necessarily dependent on how “SMART” you are, but rather the thought and effort you put into it. This includes giving your full effort into solving the problem first before reaching out for help. SMART questions help you and others better understand each other and reach a solution efficiently.

  Now, why is this process important? By taking the time to understand the problem, you can better relay the information, context, errors, etc, to those who can provide their own insight on the issue. This process helps prevent duplicate questions and boosts time efficiency. 
  Proper documentation can not only help you, but also others who are dealing with the same issues. All around, properly communicating and displaying your code is a contribution to the community as a whole. As more people find the same solution to the issue at hand, there will be less need for others to spend their efforts and time repeating themselves for the sake of others. This also prevents contributors from having to ask questions to piece together the context that is missing. 

  Here is a perfect example of a SMART question. The user clearly states the question, along with a coded example. They specifically state that they are working in Google Chrome and provide existing methods. They also once again restate that the Chrome element inspector can display CSS, showing that they have researched prior information on the topic and are now seeking extra help. These simple explanations eventually allowed someone in the comments to post a well-written solution to the issue with their own snippet of code and examples. 

  Now, looking at non-SMART questions, this person has barely provided any  context to their problem. They do not display the efforts that were made to solve the issue independently. They simply copied and pasted the error message, most likely leaving helpers to piece together the pieces on their own. This wastes the time of both parties, most likely delaying the answer that could have been easily solved. This is not only bad for the community, but also horrible for your own learning process as a whole. In general, it is difficult to learn concepts and problem-solving skills when the answers are handed to you.

  To sum it up, SMART questions are essential to the tech community as a whole. By taking the time to ask questions, everyone can reach a much faster and informative solution. This also shows mutual respect to contributors, as they take the time out of their day to assist others. By asking SMART questions, we can efficiently work together as a community to spread our knowledge and grow together.
