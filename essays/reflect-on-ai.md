# I Love AI

AI has a chokehold on the tech and every other industry in the world at the moment. Some might say that AI is deteriorating our minds by giving us the easy way out. Which is understandable, however AI can also serve as a personal assistant rather than a full on cheat code. Me along with other colleagues who have used chatbots such as ChatGPT, all use AI to help us save time on fix errors. AI can also be used as a teaching tool especially in an educational stand point. Whenever there is a concept I do not understand, I always go to ChatGPT to get a more simplified and detailed explanation. 

## ICS 314

In ICS 314, I utilized AI in almost every step of the class. Not with the intent to cheat, but rather to help me better understand where I went wrong in my thinking process. In every WOD, I would eventually have to use AI to assist me in fixing my errors, almost every time it fixed my errors pretty quickly while explaining to me just where I went wrong. This was also useful in helping me stay within the timer, as well as doing better in future WOD attempts. 

For example, in our final project for the class, I wanted to create animations so that the elements smoothly transitioned onto the user’s screen. Of course on the top of my head, I had no idea what to do or where to even start. So I pulled up ChatGPT and sure enough I was able to get a solid code snippet to start me off.  Not only did it give me the code, it also answered all of my questions pretty spot on. 

Here’s a list of how AI helped me in various situations:

1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
- Helped explain concepts and error fixes
2. In-class Practice WODs
- Practice WODS were basically learning experiences, so I used the class time to mostly talk to GPT to help me memorize concepts related to the topic 
3. In-class WODs
- When I was stuck on a issue, I would use GPT to debug and save me time so I would not DNF
4. Essays
- Like I always do, I use GPT to give me a summary of the topic so I can get a better understanding before I start writing. 
5. Final project
- I used GPT in the same way to help clear up any questions I had
6. Learning a concept / tutorial
- This is my favorite thing to use GPT for, I always ask it multiple questions relating to each topic. I also ask for a lot of examples to help me bette visualize the concepts.
7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
- I can’t comment too much on the discord but I did get an answer to many questions I would have had to ask in class. 
8. Asking or answering a smart-question
- Asking AI questions has made me take the time to ask more smart questions in order to get the best desired answer. 
9. Coding example
- I would ask it to give me examples of built in functions so I could understand better and use them myself
10. Explaining code
- I believe this could fall under the category of many other topics I discussed, but I definitely used it to explain various code snippets
11. Writing code
- Although controversial, I used GPT to write a lot of code snippets, however I always asked it to explain each line in great detail
12. Documenting code
- Being completely honest, I am not the best a documenting my code, so I definitely used GPT to help me get the right wording
13. Quality assurance
- Unfortunately because of the layout GPT was not able to fix a lot of my EsLint errors, so I had to fix them manually. 
14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed
- In the same manner as the rest of the items on this list, I use GPT to help me with my own personal projects

## Impact on Learning and Understanding

AI in general has really influenced my learning in a sense that I rely on it for almost about anything. For example when learning data structure and algorithms, I always used GPT to break down each topic into analogies. Although I will say some of my problem solving abilities have gone downhill since my use of AI, I will say that it definitely helped my understanding instead. 

## My Practical Applications

Outside of ICS 314, I’ve also used AI for a lot of other personal projects of mine. When attempting to make my own compiler in C, I used AI to break down a ton of line of code that I would not be able to understand easily on my own. Instead of struggling and spending an hour trying to piece together a couple lines of code I saved a lot of time. This exact concept can be applicable to any other software engineering task.

## Challenges

Some challenges I face using AI mostly have to do with the fact that I am too reliant on it. Over time I’ve realized I started to use AI more and more for assignments or anything in general. Another issue is that AI doesn’t always give the correct answer. When asking for super specific output, sometimes the AI doesn’t fully deliver, leading to many more questions to be asked. 

## AI vs Classrooms

Comparing AI to traditional teaching methods is quite hard. On one hand the AI chatbot can answer all of your questions in a second. You need a code snippet? Here it is in 2 seconds. Think of it as your personal tutor in a sense except without the physical concepts. Now this is nice and all, but it can be pretty hard to retain information when it is taught in such a way. Most of the time AI just solves everything for you without giving you that room to do it on your own. Traditional teaching I’d say helps build your problem solving skills way more. Instead of relying on some machine, you get the time to really apply what you learned in in-class assignments. 

## What the Future Holds

I think AI will definitely play a huge role in education in the near future. I could see it being used along side professors in a classroom as a virtual tutor. With the right regulations, I could also see it being used as a tool to improve students solving skills rather than diminishing them. If done right, it could make learning easier and more accessible for everyone. 

## Conclusion

Overall, using AI made this course a lot less stressful for me. I was able to improve my coding and learn various new concepts. Although I do think at the end of it all, I was relying on it way too much. So maybe the use of AI should be regulated more during in class WODs or assignments in general. I believe that AI should be included in a way that helps student think critically at the same time.
