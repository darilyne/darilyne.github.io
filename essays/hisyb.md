## Evaluation of TypeScript

  So far, I think TypeScript is a more approachable language considering TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. I’ve never used TypeScript before, but I’m excited to use it along with HTML and CSS. The beginning of this course felt very similar to how it was when I was learning Java at LCC. They all have static variables, classes, constructors, interfaces, and generics. However, I also noticed TypeScript has enums just like C.
  
  Some new things that I learn from the start of this course are destructuring, rest, promises, and map. Although confusing at first, I feel as if they are quite valuable built-ins. From a programming perspective, I feel as if TypeScript is a pretty good language. Compared to other languages TypeScript really seems to emphasize data types making sure each element is assigned to its respective type. I think this feature is great to protect the code from any bugs and save programmers a lot of time. 
  
  For the WODs, I feel as if they are very useful. Although I do hate the stress of having to complete it in such a short amount of time. So enjoyable? No, but I do think the practice WODs are helping me a lot. It is very easy to study a concept but programming is more hands-on, so this extra practice is helping me drill concepts into my head faster.
