## The options at hand

I originally decided to be a software engineer after career day in 5th grade. After a student’s dad came into the class, saying he made video games for a living and worked for NASA. Growing up, the idea of making video games like any other kid completely sold me on the idea. As I grew up, I began to realize the variety of software engineering has to offer. 
Although I still idolize the idea of game development, web and mobile applications are extremely interesting to me. I play a lot of phone games and use tons of applications daily. So I think it is only natural that I find mobile development extremely interesting. One day, I hope to be able to code my own app regardless of the genre.
Web development is also a huge interest of mine. I personally love the idea of the front end. Customizing the interface and controlling what the user sees piques my creative interest. In this class, I’m hoping to become more familiar with the concepts of web development. By the end, I hope I can use what I learn on my own personal projects.
Now, I don’t know if this exactly falls under software engineering, but I love the concept of AI. Now, the video and image aspect of it is very creepy. However, the machine learning aspect and its teaching abilities are a different story. Whenever I get stuck on something, I always ask GPT to explain to me step by step until I fully understand the concept. In the future, I really want to work with AI development. I think it is such an amazing tool that everyone will be able to use to improve their everyday life.
