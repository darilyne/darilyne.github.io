# Time is Money

I made time estimations based on how long I personally believe each issue would take based on my own judgement. Although the estimates were not always accurate, however having them made me better understand my work habits and how I use my time. I used the knowledge on the top of my head from my pass assignments to judge my estimates rather than exact numbers. 

Even though my estimates were not exactly accurate, they were pretty close to the desired time. For example, when adding animations to the contents of the website, I originally thought it would be rather quick. As animations were first an idea I came up with just for aesthetic purposes. However, I quickly ran into issues with icons and cards become non visible, so I had to take the time to debug and fix my approach. 

  
## Did they help?

In completely honesty, I do not believe tracking these numbers helped a TON, but it was quite interesting. When locked into work it is easy to loose track of time so its quite cool to see how much time actually flew by. However, I do believe they were a bit helpful for judging future estimates with similar amounts of workloads.


## Tracking

In complete honesty once again, I forgot a lot to time the amount each task I did took me. When I did though, I did it in a similar manner that we use for our WODs in our ICS 314 class. I used a simple stopwatch to track it and noted the time in my notes app. For the other times I did not time it, I kinda just used another estimate on the top of my head.

## What would I do differently?

If I had to do the project all over again, I would probably remind myself more to time myself and note down my time. I also would use that data to better manage my time for future tasks, as sometimes it is pretty hard to judge how much time I will waste on a single bug before it happens lol. 

## Thank God for GPT

For this project, I definitely used the help of ChatGPT to cut down on a lot of the time the tasks took me. Whenever I ran into a bug that I had no idea to fix, I just threw the question to GPT and for the most part I came to a solution pretty quick. Although sometimes it took a lot of talking back and forth between the chatbot just to get a simple fix. So I’d say it mostly just depends on how complicated the issue is.  As you know, GPT isn’t the holy grail fix to everything in life. (Unfortunately)
